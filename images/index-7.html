									<h1>Available Therapies &amp; Services</h1>
									<p>Our mission at Echelon Healing Arts is to provide you with a complete system of healing modalities to enhance your health restoration and rejuvenation. We offer Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Nutritional Counseling, Bodywork, InfiniChi, and Qigong training.</p>
									<p class="font1">Acupuncture</p>
									<p>The ancient Chinese believed in a universal life energy called Qi (pronounced “chee”) that circulates throughout every living being along pathways in the body. Health was maintained if this energy flowed freely. Pain and disease occur when these pathways are blocked and the Qi no longer flows well. Imagine body fluids stagnating like a swamp or the nervous system having a short-circuit midstream. Acupuncture is the placement of fine needles along these pathways, stimulating a focused response from the nervous, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, hormonal, and immune systems, restoring Qi movement and bringing harmony back to the body. </p>
									<p class="font1">Herbal Medicine</p>
<p>Chinese herbs have unique properties and functions that send specific messages to the organ systems. This reprograms their function and restores balance to the body. Herbal medicine works very well in conjunction with acupuncture and gives the patient the opportunity to extend their healing session at home when between acupuncture treatments. Once a diagnosis is made a personalized formula is constructed from the thousands of classic herbal combinations. The most potent and traditional way to take herbal medicine is to cook a customized raw herbal formula much like you would a soup. Another popular format is a customized herbal powder that’s made instantly by mixing with water.</p>
<p class="font1">Nutritional Counseling</p>
									<p>Nutritional knowledge in Chinese medicine has a long history and includes the healing properties of many individual foods. Before a consultation you’ll want to start by keeping a food journal for a couple weeks. You’ll record what you eat and when. Also commenting on exercise, sleep, and your daily level of energy will inform your nutritionist how your life and food are affecting one another. Your Chinese nutritional education will not only be about how to eat healthy but what’s best to include and avoid to meet specific healing goals. You'll get custom eating plans, with menus, food preparation, and places to find healthy food. Let us know if you're interested in our weight loss, detoxification, or fertility eating plans. </p>
<p class="font1">Body Work</p>
									<p>Body Work is the 4th pillar within the tradition of Chinese Medicine besides acupuncture, herbal medicine and nutrition. We call it Tuina (tway-nah), which means "push, pull." Body work involves working with muscles and joints to help improve circulation, eliminate toxins, relax and recondition muscles, increase joint lubrication and motion, and release tension and stress. It is a combination of acupressure and many other techniques that work with the same channels and theories used in acupuncture. We have body work protocols specific for detoxification and fertility. People also use body work for arthritis, stress, pain, weakness, weight management, and for disease prevention. </p>
							  <p class="font1">InfiniChi</p>
									<p>Medical energy healing, which we call InfiniChi, has been studied for 5,000 years in China. It serves as the energetic foundation for all modalities of Chinese Medicine, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and tuina (body work). The power of the body's healing systems is accessed by a transfer of energy. This is often done with an acupuncture needle, a food, or an herb. InfiniChi focuses solely on that transfer of energy without the use of a physical medium. It is a non-touch therapy where a practitioner reads and manipulates the internal and external energies of a patient to bring about healing and balance. There may also be the use of light massage, acupressure or guided visualization to further direct the flow of energy. InfiniChi works especially well for pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, headache, indigestion, irritable bowels, and pre-menstrual disorder. </p>
							  <p class="font1">Qigong</p>
									<p>Qigong loosely translates to "energy work" or "energy discipline." The most popular form is taichi but there are innumerable forms of this energy practice. Tao Of Wellness trains our patients in tai chi and chi gong to help with many conditions. It can help calm the nervous system, relieve stress and pain, enhance fertility, and improve mental focus. As well, taichi and qigong are the most popular ways to prevent disease and promote a balanced lifestyle. Tao of Wellness offers private training to learn a preset chigong form or to receive a tailor made practice for a specific health concern. Qigong provides us with a way to rediscover ourselves and our boundless internal wisdom. Join us in a lesson and experience abundant energy, greater clarity, and a deeper sense of self..							</p>
